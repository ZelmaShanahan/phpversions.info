      <h2>Operating Systems</h2>
      <p>
          Operating systems are used for both running your computer, and running web servers. Whilst you are not going to base your laptop buying decision based on which PHP version it has by default, knowing what versions
          are on what operating systems can save you some trouble in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
          More importantly, picking an OS for your web server with the right version is going to save arsing around trying to install (sometimes unofficial) repos to get it up to date.
